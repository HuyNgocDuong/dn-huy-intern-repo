# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

### 🔍 **Research & Learn**

### ✅ What are the main Agile ceremonies and their purpose?

1. **Daily Stand-ups**
    
    A 15-minute sync where each team member shares:
    
    - What they did yesterday
    - What they’re working on today
    - Any blockers (e.g., debugging an API issue)
2. **Sprint Planning (Scrum)**
    
    Planning what to complete in the next sprint. For teams using Kanban (like Focus Bear), this may be replaced by:
    
    - **Continuous Prioritization**, where the team pulls tasks as capacity allows (e.g., moving `Making API Calls with Axios` from Ready → In Progress when free)
3. **Retrospectives**
    
    Reflection on what went well or didn’t. In a previous Focus Bear retro, feedback highlighted improving async check-ins and clearer task descriptions.
    
4. **Backlog Refinement**
    
    Regularly reviewing the task backlog to ensure items like `Handling Forms with Formik` or `Coverage Bar Testing` have clear requirements and are properly prioritized.

### 🌍 **Asynchronous & Cross-Time-Zone Collaboration**

At Focus Bear, async collaboration is supported via:

- **GitHub Issues and Projects**: Each task (e.g., `dn-huy-intern-repo #81`) contains title, status, and updates
- **Pull Requests & Comments**: Used for peer reviews and technical discussion without needing live meetings
- **Discord Messages or Threads**: Short updates when stand-ups are missed
- **Stand-Up Summaries**: Shared even when members are in different time zones

This approach lets me contribute even outside standard team hours, especially when waiting on code reviews or feedback.

### 📝 **Reflection**

### ✅ How Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment

Agile ceremonies ensure **clarity and coordination**:

- **Daily stand-ups** show who’s doing what — I learned that a teammate was also working with Axios, so we avoided duplicate effort.
- **Retrospectives** let us share friction points — like when unclear API specs caused blockers, prompting a change in how tasks were documented.
- They also reinforce shared ownership of quality and delivery.

### ✅ Most important ceremony for my role

For my backend intern role, **Daily Stand-Ups** are the most essential:

- I can communicate blockers early (e.g., needing test data to proceed with Axios API testing)
- I hear what others are building — helping me understand how my work integrates with theirs (e.g., connecting my API endpoints with Formik frontends)
- It’s the best moment to request pairing help or feedback if stuck

### 🛠️ **Task**

- ✅ **Attended a stand-up** on Discord where I shared updates on:
    - Progress with `Making API Calls with Axios`
    - A blocker: confusion around token format in the auth header
    - Asked if anyone had a test payload or mock server setup
- ✅ **Reviewed retrospective notes**
    
    The last Focus Bear retrospective highlighted the need to:
    
    - Write clearer task acceptance criteria
    - Use issue comments more to document mid-task progress

### 💡 **Improvement to Team Collaboration**

One change I’ve started implementing is:

> Writing a brief comment update inside each GitHub issue when I begin working on it, including:
> 
- Current approach (e.g., “Testing Axios POST with JWT auth”)
- Questions if unclear (e.g., “Should this return a 201 or 200 on success?”)
- What I’ve completed so far

This helps team members understand where I’m at without needing to ping me or wait for the next stand-up.
