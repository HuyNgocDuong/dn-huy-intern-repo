# Kanban Workflow

# 🌀 **Agile Workflows & Kanban**

### 🔍 **Research & Learn**

A Kanban board works by displaying workflow stages through its columns starting from To Do then moving to In Progress and ending at Done to help teams manage their workflow.

A Kanban board shows work progression through stages that start at To Do before moving to In Progress then finish at Done. The board helps teams both prioritize and manage work by displaying real-time task status which enhances transparency among team members.

### 📊 **The columns on a Kanban board represent what?**

- Backlog: Tasks that are not yet prioritized for action.
- To Do: Tasks ready to be picked up.
- In Progress: Tasks actively being worked on.
- Blocked: Tasks that are currently stalled due to dependencies or issues.
- Done: Tasks that have been completed.

### 🔄 **Who handles updating tasks as they advance through the board and through which process?**

The board requires task movements which happen between each stage. Members should update their tasks with current work stages since they maintain responsibility for their assigned tasks. The workflow remains up to date while becoming visible to all team members.

---

### 🚫 **What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?**

A WIP limit enables teams to reduce context switching while working on tasks until completion before starting new ones and prevents team member overload. The system produces better workflow efficiency along with speedier completion times.

---

### 📝 **Reflection**

The Kanban method enables teams to handle priorities and prevent overloading tasks.

Kanban boards show tasks with their statuses and workload through a transparent visual system. The WIP limitation system helps teams select important tasks while preventing team members from handling excessive tasks simultaneously. Team members can focus on essential items before proceeding with new work.

### ⚙️ **How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**

- Regularly updating task statuses.
- Avoiding picking up multiple tasks at once.
- Prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance.
- Keeping blocked tasks visible to seek help or escalate faster.

### 👀 **Observation from Focus Bear’s Kanban board**

The Focus Bear Kanban board is structured into distinct columns representing stages of work:

- **Backlog**: Tasks not yet started
- **Ready**: Tasks available to pick up
- **In Progress**: Actively worked on
- **In Review**: Undergoing review
- **Done**: Completed work

Each task is represented by an issue with a title, ID, and consistent formatting (e.g., `dn-huy-intern-repo #10`). Tasks include descriptive titles, and some are organized by topic (e.g., Formik, Axios, Kanban). Labels and estimations are currently minimal but could be enhanced for prioritization and tracking.

### 🚚 **Task Movement**

I moved the task **“Agile Workflows & Kanban”** from the **Ready** column to **In Progress** to reflect that I started working on it. This update ensures visibility of task ownership and progress, aligning with Agile team practices. Once the task is completed, I plan to move it to the **Done** column after peer review if required.

### 💡 **One improvement to task tracking in my role**

I can improve task tracking by **adding detailed checklists and progress comments inside each issue**. This creates transparency around what has been done and what’s pending. Additionally, using **labels** like “High Priority” or “Blocked” would help team members quickly understand the status and urgency of tasks at a glance.
