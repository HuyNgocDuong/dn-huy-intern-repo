### ✅ Handling Sensitive Information: Storage, Sharing & Disposal

| Action | Best Practice (Focus Bear Approach) |
| --- | --- |
| **Store** | Use secure cloud platforms like **AWS** or EU-US Data Privacy Framework-compliant services. |
| **Share** | Use encrypted tools like **Zoom**, **Discord**, or **Zoho SalesIQ**. |

| Mistake | Prevention Strategy |
| --- | --- |

### 🛠️ Task

### ✅ New Habit:

“I will maintain **strict role-based access** standards by only accessing personal or internal data when necessary. I’ll ensure external tools use encryption and proper access controls before use.”

### ✅ Key Security Measure:

“I’ve learned from Focus Bear the importance of protecting **personal health and religious data** through **double encryption** and **data minimization**.

I will create a **data audit checklist** to verify that my accessed storage is encrypted, anonymous, and limited in duration.”
