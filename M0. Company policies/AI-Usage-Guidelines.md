# AI Usage Guidelines

### ❓ **Why Is This Important?**

The use of AI tools generates massive productivity gains through their ability to assist with writing tasks as well as research activities and data analysis and automation processes. AI tools can create significant hazards when professionals use them without proper consideration.

These include:

- Leaking confidential or personal data
- Sharing incorrect or outdated information
- Over-relying on AI instead of building core skills

AI provides maximum benefits when users practice responsible and secure handling of the technology.

### 🔍 **Research & Learn**

**What AI tools are typically used for your role?**

- The AI platform ChatGPT enables users to create content, summarize documents, conduct research and develop ideas.
- Grammarly / LanguageTool – grammar and tone checking
- GitHub Copilot – code suggestions, auto-complete
- Notion AI – project notes, documentation summaries
- Zapier / Make – workflow automation
- Otter.ai / Fathom – AI meeting transcriptions

**What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?**

**Benefits:**

- Speeds up repetitive or low-complexity tasks
- Enhances creativity through brainstorming support
- Provides summaries, corrections, and quick answers
- Increases accessibility (e.g., quick translations, simplified language)

**Risks:**

- Accidental disclosure of private or confidential information
- Misinformation due to incorrect or outdated data
- Diminished skills due to over-dependence on AI
- Legal or compliance issues with generated content

The ethical problems arise from using AI-generated content without proper disclosure to users.

**Which types of information should be avoided from entering AI tools?**

- Customer names, emails, phone numbers, or personal data
- Internal business plans, financials, or proprietary strategy
- Login credentials, API keys, or passwords
- Legal or compliance-sensitive documents
- Any data marked confidential or not authorized for public use

**How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content?**

- Verify the information by checking reliable sources that include company documents and academic journals
- Run code in safe testing environments
- Use fact-checking tools (e.g., Google Fact Check Explorer, Snopes)
- Ask domain experts to review the content

AI should be treated as a supporting tool because it lacks the ability to provide definitive answers.

### 📝 **Reflection**

**When should you use AI, and when should you rely on your own skills?**

**Use AI when:**

- You need help starting a draft or email
- Summarizing long content or notes
- Automating routine tasks
- Generating template content or brainstorming ideas

**Use your own skills when:**

- The task requires nuanced judgment or emotional intelligence
- The information is sensitive or company-specific
- You’re making final decisions or writing for clients or executives
- You’re building expertise in your field — learning is important!

**How can you avoid over-reliance on AI?**

- Treat AI as a helper — not the final source
- Review and edit every AI output before using
- Keep sharpening your own skills through continuous learning
- Don't let AI take away your ability to think critically or be creative
- Set a rule: “AI can assist, but I will always own the result.”

**What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**

- Never copy sensitive or confidential data into AI tools
- Use only AI platforms that meet company compliance policies
- Anonymize data when needed for context
- Read privacy and data usage policies of AI tools
- Disable prompt history or data collection if the platform allows

### 🛠️ Task

**Task improved with an AI tool:**
I used ChatGPT to create a professional Slack message which requested clarification from my teammate about the task I received.

**Did the output need editing or fact-checking?**
Yes. The message structure was good but I needed to modify the tone to match our team's communication approach. I included particular details about the task to enhance the message clarity and relevance.

**At Focus Bear I will adopt the following best practice for AI tool usage:**
I will examine all AI-generated content carefully before applying it in professional work. I will prevent entering confidential data into AI tools while making sure my activities comply with company rules regarding responsible AI use.

### 📌 **Final Note**

AI functions best as a teammate when people use it properly. The best results from AI emerge through ethical and privacy-conscious implementation along with thoughtful usage which protects trust and maintains quality standards.
