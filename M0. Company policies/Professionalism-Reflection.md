# Professionalism Reflection

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ✅ Professional vs. Unprofessional Behaviour in a Casual Work Environment

**Professional behaviours:**

- **Respectful communication:** Using polite greetings, active listening, and acknowledging others’ contributions (e.g., “Thanks for that update, it helped a lot.”).
- **Being dependable:** Completing tasks on time, following through on commitments, and being available during core working hours.
- **Team-oriented mindset:** Offering help without being asked, and collaborating on shared goals.
- **Appropriate conduct:** Maintaining a friendly tone without crossing professional boundaries, even in casual attire environments.

**Unprofessional behaviours:**

- **Disrespectful tone:** Using passive-aggressive language, sarcasm, or ignoring messages entirely.
- **Disregard for meeting etiquette:** Arriving late without notice, multitasking, or being distracted during meetings.
- **Insubordination or negativity:** Publicly criticizing team decisions, complaining constantly, or refusing to cooperate.
- **Lack of boundaries:** Oversharing or making jokes that may offend others.

### 💬 What Respectful Communication Looks Like in Remote Teams

- **Tone:** Keep a warm and professional tone. Begin messages with greetings and end with appreciation (e.g., “Hi John, thanks for reviewing the draft!”).
- **Clarity:** Be concise and clear. Avoid overly long or ambiguous sentences.
- **Handling disagreements:** Focus on facts rather than opinions (e.g., “The timeline might be tight for this task—can we reassess priorities?” instead of “This is impossible to do.”).
- **Responding to feedback:** Say “Thank you for the feedback,” even if it’s tough. Ask follow-up questions to clarify rather than taking offense.
- **Consideration:** Respect time zones, workload, and people’s communication preferences (e.g., some may prefer async replies).

### 🤝 Giving and Receiving Feedback Professionally

**When giving feedback:**

- Focus on actions, not personality: “It would help if we could submit by the deadline next time,” instead of “You’re unreliable.”
- Use “I” statements to reduce defensiveness: “I found it difficult to follow the report—maybe adding headings would help?”
- Be timely: Give feedback while it’s still relevant.

**When receiving feedback:**

- Stay open-minded and thank the person.
- Ask for examples if the feedback is unclear.
- Reflect before responding emotionally.
- Treat it as a growth opportunity rather than a personal attack.

### 🌟 Have You Experienced Great Teamwork and Professionalism?

Yes. During a previous group project, each member had defined roles, and communication was consistent through daily stand-ups. We respected each other’s time and ideas. Constructive feedback was shared openly, and everyone had the space to contribute. This made the team efficient, motivated, and successful.

### 📬 Following Up and Escalating

**Follow-up process:**

- A friendly first reminder should be sent between one to two business days which includes a note saying:
    
    “Hi [Name], just wanted to see if you managed to view this?”
    
- In the second reminder, you should emphasize either the time deadline or the project importance:
    
    e.g., “This is due on Thursday, and I need your input to proceed.”
    
- I will reach out to my supervisor or team leader when I cannot make any progress because of a lack of response.
    
    The message should be delivered with proper politeness:
    
    “I have sent two follow-up messages but I have not received any response. What is the best way forward?”
