# Working with Vulnerable Populations

## 🔍 **RESEARCH & LEARN**

👥 **Which groups qualify as vulnerable populations along with their anticipated digital space challenges?**

✅ **Vulnerable Populations Include:**

- Neurodivergent individuals together with people who have Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD and Dyslexia constitute a vulnerable group.
- Older users face difficulties because their vision weakens while their memory and motor skills deteriorate.
- People with physical disabilities together with sensory and cognitive disabilities and other related conditions.
- People whose native language is not English face obstacles because they have restricted proficiency in speaking English.
- People who do not have easy access to digital tools nor understand technology basics.

⚠️ **Challenges They Face Online:**

- The user interface presents itself through patterns that are confusing and difficult to follow.
- Auto-play content alongside fast-paced interactions cause users stress.
- Users experience difficulties because they find navigation through the system confusing.
- Users experience difficulties due to language complexity and unclear instructions in the system.
- The system fails to provide alternative formats such as captions alongside screen reader support and alt text.

## 📝 **REFLECTION**

💡 **1. Describe your method for adapting your communication approach to support neurodivergent users among your team members.**

- You should present your information directly without any ambiguity.
- Use direct wording instead of abstract expressions when you say “Let’s begin working on this assignment now” instead of “Let’s begin running immediately.”
- Use specific instances instead of theoretical terms.
- The information should be divided into smaller bite-sized parts for better understanding.
- Use short paragraphs along with simple lists instead of long ones.
- The list will be presented with bullets followed by numbered points and finally with date-specific short summaries.

📅 **Use structure and consistency**

- All your messages should use consistent formatting since it produces better results.
- The message should clearly show the deadline as:
    
    **“Please submit by Friday at 3 PM AEDT.”**
    
- The system must provide repeated information through summary statements.
- Neurodivergent users need additional information about important content points because they require multiple presentations.
- The meeting summary should contain three key points as follows:
    1. Review the document
    2. Make your comments by Wednesday
    3. We will discuss it on Thursday
- The team should welcome members to ask for clarification while also asking for feedback.
    
    > “Please inform me if there are any questions because I am ready to answer them.”
    > 
- Avoid using phrases like “Obviously…” and “Just do it like last time” since these expressions create a false assumption about common understanding.
- The communication tone needs to be both non-pressing and compassionate.
    
    Use phrases like:
    
    - “Take your time.”
    - “You can do this at your own pace.”
    - “The process has no time limits, so inform me whenever you are prepared to proceed.”

🎯 *The goal is to assist users in handling information through approaches which create feelings of safety and manageability.*

🚧 **2. Which typical UX or communication issues could reduce Focus Bear's usability and support capabilities?**

❌ **UX Pitfalls:**

- A combination of bright colors and sounds with confetti and fast transitions produces overwhelming sensory experiences.
- Users become confused because identical page titles appear multiple times throughout the system.
- Timers which activate automatically and screens that advance without user input create feelings of anxiety in users.
- The implementation of rigid goal systems through deadline-based punishment which displays red alerts or "fail" screens negatively affects users' self-esteem and motivation.

💬 **Communication Pitfalls:**

- The instruction to “Manage distractions better” remains unclear since it does not provide enough details about the process.
- The language used in competitive messages such as “Crush your goals!” and “Level up or fall behind” causes stress among users.
- A single approach to productivity does not fit all because ADHD/Autism individuals experience variable levels of focus and energy.
- The design of inclusion requires both pressure reduction and recognition of unique cognitive patterns.

🔧 **3. Which work-related change can you implement today to improve your support for vulnerable populations?**

🌱 **Create a low-stimuli or neurodivergent-friendly mode:**

- The UI design should feature neutral colors while eliminating animations and maintaining a minimalistic appearance.
- The system defaults to a silent mode that suppresses all audio notifications.
- The user interface presents a single task at a time with the ability to hide sections using collapse functionality.

💬 **Supportive Microcopy:**

Use phrases like:

- “You’ve got this.”
- “Let’s try again.”
- “Small steps are big wins.”

👨‍💻 **Example:**

You need to design a productivity screen for your project.

**Standard view:**

- Task + timer + progress bar + reward badge

**🧠 Gentle Mode:**

- Shows just one task
- No timer unless enabled
- The text encourages users to start with a minimal action by saying:
    
    > “Let’s begin with a tiny step.”
    > 

### 🛠️ Task

📖 Read a **first-person account** from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools.

Kate Arends writes on Wit & Delight about how momentum along with simplicity serve as essential elements for ADHD users when using productivity tools. The hardest part of any action she has always understood to be starting which is why building momentum becomes essential for her. People with ADHD experience extreme difficulty with transitions thus the momentum principle acts as a sustaining force for their progress. She depends on several tools that include a minimal morning schedule and a physical planner and multiple timers and The Brick distraction blocker and headphones for concentration. The author emphasizes that users with ADHD need digital tools with simple interfaces because cluttered systems with multiple features create overwhelming experiences that decrease productivity [1].

The Reddit platform contains an open discussion which reveals several ADHD community members declaring that pen and notebook represent their most effective organizational tools. Writing with index cards and handwriting proves more manageable than complex digital systems according to them which confirms that too many features act as obstacles instead of advantages [2].

ADHD coach Jo Banks suggests people use the Pomodoro Technique with adjustable work time intervals to suit their individual requirements. The reward-motivated nature of individuals with ADHD requires immediate feedback and positive reinforcement following every challenging assignment according to her observations [3].

### 🛠️ Focus Bear needs an improvement in its design which involves:

The interviewed users strongly emphasize that a simplified interface design represents their top priority which includes basic features and large text and progressive complexity addition. The system needs an ultra-simplified mode that deletes all unnecessary components to stop users from feeling overwhelmed. The implementation of segmented onboarding alongside positive feedback messages with a calm tone would create better support for ADHD and autistic users.

### ✅ **A person dealing with executive function challenges should receive support from the following statement**

The experience of executive functioning produces overwhelming feelings when it makes everyday assignments appear overwhelmingly challenging. The introduction of basic tools like physical notebooks or timer applications proves helpful for both individuals with ADHD and those with autism. Celebrate every bit of progress, no matter how small. When an application seems complicated you can check for simplified settings or get assistance because you join many users who need effective tools that meet their requirements.
