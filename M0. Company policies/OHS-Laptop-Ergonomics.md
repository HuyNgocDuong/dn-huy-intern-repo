# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

### 🔍 **Research & Learn**

**Using a laptop without external monitor or keyboard exposure poses what types of risks?**

The design of laptops with built-in display and keyboard forces users into an unnatural posture because they must bend their necks and shoulders while using the device. The combination of poor posture creates multiple health issues that include back pain and neck discomfort and eyesight problems along with repetitive strain injuries that cause carpal tunnel syndrome.

**Which ergonomic equipment devices help users achieve better posture while working on a laptop?**

- A **laptop stand** functions as a screen elevation tool which enables users to place the display at their eye level.
- The use of **external keyboards together with mice** provides users with better opportunities to position their arms and wrists correctly.
- **Ergonomic chairs** with built-in lower back support systems help users maintain correct spinal alignment for better posture.
- A **footrest** serves as a tool for maintaining correct alignment between legs and feet.

**People should modify their monitor heights and desk arrangements together with chair positions to create a healthier workspace environment.**

- The highest point of the monitor screen must stay at or slightly below eye level.
- The feet must touch the floor completely while maintaining a 90-degree knee angle with hips positioned above knees.
- The desk should be arranged so typing elbows reach 90 degrees while wrists remain straight with forearms parallel to the floor.

**The following habits help decrease the negative effects that prolonged laptop use has on the body.**

- Take short **movement breaks every 30–60 minutes**
- Perform **posture checks** at regular intervals during the workday
- Follow the **20-20-20 rule** by looking at distant objects twenty feet away for twenty seconds every twenty minutes
- **Stretch regularly**, especially the neck, shoulders, and wrists

### 📝 **Reflection**

**Select equipment modifications which will enhance your workspace configuration.**

The first step toward improvement involves using a laptop stand to elevate the display to eye level while using an external keyboard and mouse to maintain proper arm alignment. I need to adjust my chair height to achieve better posture.

**To reduce strain and improve posture you should adopt which behavioural changes?**

My daily routine will include sitting with proper posture by placing my feet flat on the floor while my back receives back support.

The breaks I take throughout my day will include short sessions along with simple stretching movements to reduce tension in my neck and shoulders.

**I need a method to keep myself alert and maintain proper posture while working throughout the day.**

I will use **Focus Bear** to create movement and posture check schedules which will alert me at specific times during the day. I will put a small note on my laptop display as a visual reminder to maintain good posture.

### 🛠️ **Task**

✅ I transformed my laptop workstation through placing the device on a stand and linking it to an external mouse and keyboard.

✅ The **laptop stand** functions as a vital piece of equipment because it allows me to position the screen at eye level thus enhancing my posture.

✅ My daily work experience with **Focus Bear's movement reminders** brought me improved focus and reduced my muscle stiffness. My breaks minimized eye fatigue and maintained my concentration.

✅ I recorded this adjustment by writing down the positive impact it had on my neck and back which both experienced significant improvement from screen elevation combined with periodic breaks.
