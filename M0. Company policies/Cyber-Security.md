### ❓ Why is this important?

Cyber security breaches can lead to data leaks, financial loss, and reputational damage.

Everyone at Focus Bear plays a role in keeping information safe by following good security habits.

### 🔍 **Research & Learn Summary**

**Common Cybersecurity Threats for Remote Workers:**

- Users face two primary security risks through phishing emails that demand credentials and download malware and unsecured Wi-Fi connections which enable data theft.
- **Phishing emails** that trick users into revealing credentials or downloading malware.
- Remote workers expose their data when using unsecured Wi-Fi networks.
- The loss or theft of devices creates security risks which lead to potential data breaches.
- The downloading of unsafe materials exposes users to **malware and ransomware infections**.
- Account vulnerability increases when users select weak passwords which they reuse multiple times.

**Best Practices for Device and Account Protection:**

- The combination of **strong unique passwords** with at least 12 characters that use symbols and numbers and have mixed case letters.
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** on all important accounts.
- Regular software and app updates must be implemented.
- Public Wi-Fi networks should be avoided but using a VPN provides encryption protection.
- When your screen remains unattended you should always lock it for preventing unauthorized access.
- The need to lock screens becomes essential when working in shared or remote areas because of security risks.
- The security practice blocks unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information.
    
    The implementation of this security measure stops both unintended modifications and unauthorized information leaks.
    
    Shared workspaces as well as coworking areas and travel environments require this essential security practice.
    

**Handling Phishing Attempts:**

- The user should never tap on suspicious links or download unknown attachments from emails.
- Check the origin of the email sender through their provided email address.
- Every security team must receive notification about detected phishing attempts.
- Email filtering tools along with security awareness training programs should be implemented to prevent phishing attempts.

**Powerful Passwords & Management:**

- A strong password needs to reach 12 characters while including both uppercase and lowercase letters along with numbers and symbols.
- The use of dictionary words together with personal information should be strictly avoided in passwords.
- Users should use password managers like Bitwarden and 1Password to create and save complex passwords.
- The implementation of 2FA provides protection to accounts in case passwords become vulnerable to breaches.

### 📝 **Reflection**

**Current Security Practices:**

- I maintain strong passwords and maintain my software with regular updates.
- My goal includes both 2FA implementation across all accounts and avoiding the practice of saving passwords through browsers.

**Methods to Establish Lasting Secure Behavior:**

- The security checks should be done regularly by performing them once every month or quarter.
- The use of a password manager helps users generate and store complex and unique passwords.
- Security training must become a continuous part of personal professional growth.
- Security awareness must remain noticeable throughout regular work activities.

**Actions to Protect Passwords & Accounts:**

- The implementation of 2FA needs to be enabled across all platforms.
- The secure management of passwords through a password manager should be used.
- The practice of reusing passwords on different websites should be prevented.
- The passwords need to be checked and updated during each quarterly review period.

**In Case of a Breach or Suspicious Activity:**

- All affected accounts require password changes to be done as soon as possible.
- The security team needs to receive immediate notification about the incident.
- Run antivirus/malware scans on the devices which have been compromised.
- System administrators should check account activity logs to detect any additional signs of unauthorized access.

### 🛠️ **Task Completion**

- Work account passwords and 2FA authentication now function with maximum strength.
- The implementation of a secure password manager is now operational.
- The system automatically locks all devices after three minutes of inactivity while providing access through biometric verification methods.
- The scheduled monthly review includes password update and account removal of inactive accounts together with login password assessment.
