# Git Setup & Document Your Knowledge

Have you used Git before?
Yes. I have used Git for university assignments and personal projects to manage code versions, collaborate with teammates, and back up work. Most of my previous experience was through Git commands in the terminal and GitHubâ€™s web interface.

Which Git client did you choose? Why?
I chose GitHub Desktop because it provides a clear visual interface for commits, branches, and merges. It makes it easier to see the history and changes without memorizing every Git command, and it integrates seamlessly with GitHub for pushing and pulling updates.

Most interesting thing I learned today
I learned that Git stores changes as snapshots of a project at a certain point in time, rather than saving full copies of files. This makes it both space-efficient and fast. I also learned about the staging area, which allows me to select exactly which changes to commit before sending them to the repository.
