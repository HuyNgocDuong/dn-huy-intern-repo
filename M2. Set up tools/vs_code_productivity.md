## Reflection

Which will be most useful in daily work?
The most time-saving benefits will come from using multi-cursor shortcuts together with bulk selection features when performing repetitive edits or refactoring tasks. The Quick navigation (Ctrl+P) feature allows me to move between files quickly without interrupting my train of thought.

Shortcuts enhance productivity through the following ways:

- Reduce reliance on the mouse.
- Perform repetitive actions in bulk.
- Quickly navigate between files, lines, and symbols.
- Make frequent small changes without slowing down.
