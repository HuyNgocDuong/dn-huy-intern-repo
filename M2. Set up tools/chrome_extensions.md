# Set Up Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

## âœ… Chrome Extensions Reflection

### 1. Which Extensions Did You Install? Why?

**React Developer Tools**

I used this extension to check the React component tree structure and its properties and internal state. It allows you to use Chrome DevTools to debug React applications by adding a "Components" tab to the developer tools. It also shows component render performance and helps identify unnecessary re-renders [1].

**Redux DevTools**

This extension allows you to see the Redux state changes and dispatched actions in a timeline format. It also supports time-travel debugging, state snapshots, and even replaying state sequences to diagnose bugs more efficiently [2].

**JSON Viewer**

This extension is used to format and colorize raw JSON responses to make them easier to read. It also collapses nested structures and allows quick navigation through large datasets, ideal for RESTful API development [3].

**Lighthouse**

I used Lighthouse to audit my web appâ€™s performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. It gives a numeric score for each metric and actionable tips to improve them. Itâ€™s extremely helpful for optimizing apps before deployment [4].

### 2. What Was the Most Useful Thing You Learned?

The most useful insight came from using **React Developer Tools**, where I could:

- Observe the React component tree.
- Monitor state and props in real time.
- Debug rendering behavior with clarity.

Additionally, **Redux DevTools** showed the power of visualizing state over time and helped me trace bugs caused by asynchronous or incorrect actions.
